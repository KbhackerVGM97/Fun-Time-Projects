Astrologers are agreed that the squiggles called a horoscope contain some sort of message to be decoded...
There is no better boat than a horoscope to help a man cross over the sea of life.
Who needs astrology?  The wise man gets by on fortune cookies.
We are born at a given moment, in a given place and, like vintage years of wine, we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born.  Astrology does not lay claim to anything more.
A wise man shall overrule his stars, and have a greater influence upon his own content than all the constellations and planets of the firmament.
