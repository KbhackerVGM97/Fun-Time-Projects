Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent!
I'd like to kick you in the teeth, but why should I improve your looks
If I had a face like yours. I'd sue my parents!
Don't think, it may sprain your brain!
Fellows like you don't grow from trees; they swing from them.
How come you're here? I thought the zoo is closed at night!
I know you're a self-made man. It's nice of you to take the blame!
I've seen people like you, but I had to pay admission!
How much refund do you expect on your head now that it's empty.
